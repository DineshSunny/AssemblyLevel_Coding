This repository contains coursework and lab assignments focused on low-level programming and computer architecture concepts. Topics include register operations, memory addressing, stack and subroutine management, interrupt handling, and bitwise manipulation. Implemented various assembly-level programs using Easy68K, such as vector reversal, matrix multiplication, and Hamming (7,4) code for error detection and correction.
